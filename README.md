# android-challenge

One of the first things we need to do for efficient automation on Android is to communicate with the runtime of an app.

However, SDKs are very painful to manage, so instead, we want to be able to modify existing APKs so that we can communicate with them.

So here is the challenge:

Can you modify the app [Pocket](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro) so that when it launches, it now starts by printing out "Hello Waldo" to logcat?

## Submit

This is not really an implementation challenge per se. We'd like to read your thinking process, and be able to assess that it works as advertised.

So please send to developers@waldo.io the modified apk (or a link to it) along with a short documentation of what you did to get there.
